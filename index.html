          <h2>hi.</h2>
          <p>
          I'm Joel, a Southern California native, active tech enthusiast, and
          computer science student at the University of California, Riverside.
          </p>
          <p>
          In addition to an average course load, I volunteer my time and 
          experience to host technical workshops on topics that I'm passionate 
          about. Some of my workshops have been on topics like creating 
          embedded projects using Raspberry Pi, 
          <a href="https://ucr-iot.firebaseapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Internet of Things</a>, 
          and a "car hacking" workshop with CAN bus.
          </p>
          <p>
          I love tech, but I'm also a fan of woodworking and
          fabrication--I like building things across all media!

          <h2>a bit more about me.</h2>
          <p>
          I've had a fascination with electronics as far back as I can remember.
          As a little boy, I was especially drawn to anything with flashing
          lights and sounds or anything that was remote-controlled. My favorite
          movies growing up were the <em>Back to the Future</em> trilogy, 
          <em>Short Circuit</em>, and pretty much anything with techy gadgets 
          and robots.
          </p>
          <p>
          My interest shifted to computers around junior high when my parents
          brought home a desktop PC for my older sister and me. My curiosity
          guided me along an accelerated learning curve as I stayed up for hours
          trying to fix whatever damage I had done as a result of poking around
          in system files and registry settings before anyone would notice.
          </p>
          <h4>Automotive Industry</h4>
          <p>
          Toward the end of high school and for a few years thereafter, I
          became obsessed with car electronics and developed a career as an
          automotive electronics technician. In this industry, I held positions 
          as an installation technician and technical trainer, and leadership 
          roles including lead technician and department supervisor. During my 
          career in mobile electronics, I self-studied and became certified as 
          a MECP (Mobile Electronics Certified Professional) Master-level 
          technician and an ASE (Automotive Service Excellence) A6 certified 
          technician. In addition, I was also invited by the Consumer 
          Technology Association (formally Consumer Electronics Association) to 
          be a contributing member to the 
          <a href="https://mecp.com/Professionals/About-Certification.aspx" 
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            MECP program</a> as a credited contributing author to the MECP 
          Advanced and MECP Master study guides and accompanying professional 
          certification exams. 
          </p>
          <h4>University of California, Riverside</h4>
          <p>
          Today, I continue to challenge myself through my studies as an
          undergraduate at UCR in the field of computer science while staying up
          to date on emerging consumer technology.
